# Out of box authentication 

## Scenario 
Using the terraform configuration, we have a cluster deployed with the out of box identity configuration. I'm going to create two new users, the first user is going to be an azure AD user and the second will be a local cluster user 

Azure AD user - devuser1
local k8s user = devuser2 

## creating a local k8s user


## enabling Azure RBAC for an existing k8s cluster
